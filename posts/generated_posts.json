Starting today, Reddit moderators will not be able to change if their subreddit is public or private without first submitting a request to a Reddit admin. The policy applies to adjusting all community types, meaning moderators will have to request to make a switch from safe for work to not safe for Work, too. By requiring admin approval for the changes, Reddit is taking away a lever many communities used to protest the company’s API pricing changes last year. By going private, the community becomes inaccessible to the public, making the platform less usable for the average visitor.“The ability to instantly change Community Type settings has been used to break the platform and violate our rules,” Reddit VP of community Laura Nestler writes in a post on r/modnews.\n\n❓ What are your thoughts on this news?

The lawsuit revolves around Samsung’s “Auto Blocker” feature, which now comes turned-on-by-default on new Samsung phones. While it’�s turned on, it automatically keeps users from installing apps unless they come from “authorized sources” — namely, Google and Samsung “The thing’S not designed to protect against malware,” says Epic CEO Tim Sweeney. “The things’re designed to prevent competition.” Epic claims it now requires “an exceptionally onerous 21-step process” to download a third- party app store onto a Samsung phone, making it that much more likely users will give up somewhere along the way.\n\n❓ What are your thoughts on this news?

Oura Ring has a clever-gap design, which means it doesn’t matter if your fingers bloat or gain a few pounds. The next ring on the chopping block is the $269 EvieRing, but it hurts me to write this because it’s the prettiest and most comfortable of the six. Most smart rings tend to be indistinguishable from one, but the first-gen design and comfort were the only factors that would win it off. If you’re not accurate and syncing is a chore, what is the point of a smart ring? It’d be one thing if this was a one-off. It was not. Most people want smart rings for health tracking. But the real kicker is the charger is an easily misplaced USB stick. Easily my least favorite of the bunch.\n\n💭 What are your thoughts on this news?

The most unsettling part is the demo uses current, widely available technology like the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. Facial recognition tech has been frighteningly accurate for a while now, and I-XRAY is largely just chaining together a bunch of existing technologies. It relies in part on PimEyes, which The New York Times described in 2022 as an “alarmingly accurate” face search engine that “anyone can use.” The students say their goal is to raise awareness that all this isn’t some dystopian future — it's all possible now with existing technology.

CEO Patrick Spence has admitted that with the new app, Sonos moved too fast and failed to recognize the full gravity of bugs, missing features, and reduced functionality that led to an overwhelmingly negative reception upon its debut in May. Sonos says major changes to its app will now be released gradually and that customers can opt in to test new features. In contrast to the automated app release we issued in May, any major change to the Sonos app will be allowing customers to adjust the scope and provide feedback before it becomes the default. For new features, we will introduce an opt-in experimental option in the app for customers who would like to participate in testing them. For everyone whose trust in the company has been shaken, that’s at least evidence that Sonos has learned a critical lesson.\n\n💭 What are your thoughts on this news?
