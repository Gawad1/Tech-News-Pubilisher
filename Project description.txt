Tech News Scraper and Social Media Poster
Project Overview:
The Tech News Scraper and Social Media Poster is an automation project designed to streamline the process of discovering and sharing the latest tech news. The script will scrape popular tech news websites for trending stories, summarize the content, and format it for social media posts. The final posts will be sent for your manual review and approval before being published on Facebook or other social media platforms, following a set schedule.

This project combines the following components:

Web Scraping: Extracting trending headlines and key points from tech news websites.
Content Formatting: Summarizing and structuring the content into a post format for social media.
Approval System: Storing the posts for manual review before publishing.
Scheduling and Posting: Automatically posting the approved content to social media at scheduled times.
Key Features:
Automated Tech News Gathering: Scrape leading tech news websites like TechCrunch, The Verge, and Wired to gather fresh content daily.
Post Summarization: Summarize the headlines and key points into short, engaging social media posts.
Manual Review: Save the posts in a temporary storage (e.g., a simple database or file) for manual approval.
Scheduled Posting: Post the approved content to Facebook or other platforms according to a predefined schedule (e.g., twice a day).
Customization: Easily modify the scraping sources, post templates, and platforms.
Technologies:
Python: Main programming language for web scraping, text processing, and scheduling.
BeautifulSoup/Requests/Selenium: For scraping content from websites.
Facebook Graph API: For posting content to Facebook.
SQLite or CSV: For temporary storage of scraped posts awaiting approval.
Flask/Django or CLI: A simple user interface or command-line tool for post approval.
Scheduler (APScheduler or Cron): For scheduling posts to go live.
How the Workflow Looks:
Scraping Phase:

Scrape trending tech stories from a set of websites (like TechCrunch, The Verge).
Extract headlines, summary paragraphs, and relevant URLs.
Content Processing:

Format the extracted content into social media post templates.
Example: "ðŸš€ Latest in Tech: {headline}. Read more here: {url}"
Approval System:

Store the posts in a review system (could be a database or a file).
You receive notifications (email or CLI/GUI) with the option to review and approve or reject the post.
Post Scheduling:

Once approved, the script schedules the post for publication on Facebook or other platforms using the relevant API.
Example: Schedule posts for morning and evening each day.
Post to Social Media:

Use Facebook Graph API or another social media API to post the content at the scheduled time.
Project Scope:
Step 1: Set up the environment and install necessary libraries for web scraping and API integration.
Step 2: Build the web scraper to collect trending tech stories.
Step 3: Write functions to process the content into a social media-friendly format.
Step 4: Create a manual approval process for reviewing and approving posts.
Step 5: Implement a scheduling mechanism to post the approved content at specific times.
Step 6: Connect with Facebook or other social media APIs to automatically post the content.
Why Itâ€™s Useful:
Automates repetitive tasks: Keeps you on top of tech trends without having to manually search for news daily.
Ensures quality control: Allows you to review posts before they go live, so your feed remains high-quality and relevant.
Consistency: Posts are scheduled and published consistently without gaps, ensuring that youâ€™re always engaging your audience with fresh content.
